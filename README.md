# Project Name

Catch The Logo

## About Project

It’s a simple game that can improve the user’s finger mobility. Simply, the logo which I prepared for the AYBU Business School, will appear in the screen and when the user touch it it will increase the user’s score. Also Catch The Logo can be play in 3 difficulty mode. Users can change the difficulty in order to make the game easier or harder. The game will only run on android devices. With the usage of android it can be more accessible and usable. It’s the most common operating system and for me, it will help to popularize my game.
